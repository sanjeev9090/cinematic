# Get-Movie-Details

This is a React app created with React, Redux. This App provides trending and searched movies and TV shows, and all necessary details of each movie/TV show on clicking on that.

I used React Router for navigation, Redux for State Management, Pagination for changing page.

I used Debouncing techinique in search bar to avoid unnecessary Network Request and to save user bandwidth.
